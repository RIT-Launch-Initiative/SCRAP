# SCRAP

## Summary
SCRAP, or the System for Controlling and Recording Airbrake Performance, is a novel payload flight computer developed by the RIT Launch Initiative for use in the 2023 payload, ANNE. ANNE is the deployed payload that is planned to be launched on KONG at the Spaceort America Cup in 2023.

SCRAP handles a number of critical flight operations. Its most important function is to carry out the primary experiment that ANNE is intended to complete; opening and closing airbrakes and measuring their effect on drag and general flight conditions. It monitors another wide sensor suite and logs more than 140 bytes of data once every 50 milliseconds to dual-redundant flash memory chips. This data includes general ambient conditions as well as parameters relating to the health and functionality of the vehicle. Of note, SCRAP is the team's first implementation of of power monitoring for COTS systems, allowing us to remotely monitor the state of our COTS recovery systems, and understand their health before launch.
